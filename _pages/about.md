I am currently pursuing a master's degree in the [FastLab](http://zju-fast.com/) at the College of Control Science and Engineering, Zhejiang University, under the supervision of Professor [Chao Xu](http://zju-fast.com/research-group/chao-xu/) and Professor [Yanjun Cao](http://zju-fast.com/research-group/yanjun-cao/). Previously, I obtained a bachelor's degree in Automation from Shandong University with the honor of Excellent graduation thesis (top 2%).

My research interests include multi-robot collaboration and relative localization. I am also interested in mechanical design and reinforcement learning. In the area of multi-robot collaboration, I contributed to the development of a relative localization system, CREPES (with a related article submitted to IEEE TRO). In mechanical design, I participated in the development of a reconfigurable tracked robot, CubeTrack (with a related paper accepted as an oral presentation at IROS 2024).

I am deeply fascinated by robotics's future and committed to advancing research in this field. If you're interested in discussing my work or potential collaborations, feel free to email me.
